README

uSnap is Checkpoint / restart manager in kernel level,
thus kernel modification follows. Our current modification
is done in linux-4.9.27, mostly in files whose prefix is "uSnap_" throughout kernel.

"module" directory has some programs which make possible to 
checkpoint / restart programs by users.

"test" directory has programs which we can or should checkpoint.


--------------------- How to ----------------------

First, download debian image thorugh debootstrap

$ ./down_image.sh

If you want to mount this image and add some files into this,

$ ./mount.sh

~ Adding / removing files ~

$ ./umount.sh

To run uSnap enabled kernel,
